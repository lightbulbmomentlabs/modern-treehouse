            Positioned at the edge of the Balcones Preserve, this 2019 modern residence offers a rare convergence of architectural sophistication and untouched natural beauty. Floor-to-ceiling glass dissolves the boundary between interior and landscape, while the quiet street ensures your sanctuary remains undisturbed.
          </p>
          <p class="introduction-text">
            Clean Nordic-inspired lines define the architecture, where diamond-polished concrete floors reflect natural light throughout open living spaces. Warm European white oak flooring and millwork provide organic counterpoint to the refined minimalism, while slender-profile aluminum window systems maximize transparency without visual interruption. The result is a home that breathes with the landscape rather than imposing upon it.
          </p>
          <p class="introduction-text">
            From the cantilevered primary suite balcony extending into the oak canopy to the spa-caliber ensuite with freestanding tub, every detail reinforces the connection between sophisticated modern living and Hill Country wilderness. Directly bordering the protected Balcones preserve, the home offers immediate access to nature while remaining minutes from Lake Travis recreation and the acclaimed Lake Travis Independent School District.
